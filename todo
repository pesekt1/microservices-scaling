- Remove bank service from kubernetes cluster - it should actually run outside to properly simulate the real world scenario, you can run it from the shell script after the kubectl apply command.
- Explore other metrics for scaling - for example pod CPU usage, etc.
- Find a better way to work with repetitive env variables in docker-compose and kubernetes manifests. For example, if I change a queue name I would like to change it in a single place.
- improve the docker-compose - create proper networking
- Integrate prometheus with graphana to show the metrics in a dashboard
- Create an event in MySQL to delete all data from transactions table every 60min - otherwise it just accumulates.
- Show rolling updates in Kubernetes: 
  - We need a CI/CD pipeline that creates a latest docker image and pushes it to Dockerhub. 
  - Then we need to run kubernetes deployment job.
  - We can set Kubernetes for rolling updates so the microservice replicas will be updated one at the time.
  - There should also be some testing but we can do it later
- Should there be a gateway - like Kong API?
- tilt + K3d - kubernetes hot reloading - like docker-compose volumes on source code
- helm charts - set up base yaml for service and deployment which can be reused by dynamically setting the values
