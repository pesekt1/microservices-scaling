- improve the docker-compose - create proper networking
- Integrate prometheus with graphana to show the metrics in a dashboard
- Create an event in MySQL to delete all data from transactions table every 60min - otherwise it just accumulates.
- Create a frontend for the consumer
- Show rolling updates in Kubernetes: 
  - We need a CI/CD pipeline that creates a latest docker image and pushes it to Dockerhub. 
  - Then we need to run kubernetes deployment job.
  - We can set Kubernetes for rolling updates so the consumer replicas will be updated one at the time.
  - There should also be some testing but we can do it later
- Add a fraud detection microservice that will check if the transaction is fraudulent. It will add status and reason. It will send the processed messages to new queues: save-transaction and fraud-transaction.
